## CJ talks Node.js at Scale

CJ gave a fantastic talk about [Node.js at scale](http://nodesummit.com/media/node-js-at-scale/) a few weeks back at Node Summit. Make sure to catch her impression of the CouchDB logo.

## private modules are almost here!

Would you mind [telling us](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/113172137370/npm-private-modules-are-coming-soon) what you’re planning to use them for?

## jQuery and npm, part 3

In the past few weeks, we’ve shown you how you can publish and use jQuery plugins with npm. This week, we show you how you can make [a few small changes to your jQuery plugin](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/112712169830/making-your-jquery-plugin-work-better-with-npm) to make it a little easier for your users to use with npm tools like Browserify.

## What’s new in the CLI

In npm@2.7.0, there were a number of little changes that make npm just a little bit easier to work with.

* You can run npm ls with `--dev` or `--prod`.
* When you use npm run-script to see what [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) are set up in package.json, it will show two lists: one for lifecycle scripts like install or postpublish, and another for scripts that you run with npm run.
* When you use npm init to set up your package.json, you can add a scope… more on scopes coming soon.

Thanks to friend of npm [@watilde](https://twitter.com/watilde) for these fixes! and for [translating](https://medium.com/@watilde) a lot of our posts to Japanese :)
